Differences:

RAID-5 requires minimum three drives and can tolerate failure of one drive. 
RAID-6 requires minimum four drives and can tolerate failure of two drives.
While RAID-5 uses striping and parity, RAID-6 also uses it but in a form of double parity.
This gives the ability of recovering the data when two drives fail.

Advantages:
RAID-5:
More storage efficient (3 vs 4 drives required).
More cost efficient.

RAID-6:
Better data protection.
Better fault tolerance.

Disadvantages:
RAID-5:
Parity can impact the performance, espacially during write operations.
Long rebuild times.
Limited fault tolerance.

RAID-6:
High hardware and complexity requirements
High cost
Slower write performance, similar to the RAID-5s
Reduced storage efficiency due to two drive requirement for dual parity


LDAP:

Centralized User Management, allowing to create, modify, and delete user accounts, as well as manage group memberships from a single, central directory server.

Single Sign-On (SSO), allowing users to log in once and access multiple services and resources without the need to enter credentials repeatedly.

Enhanced Security, including strong password policies, account lockouts, and account expiration.

Integration with Other Services, as they are widely supported by a variety of applications and services, allowing integration with various different systems, especially Microsoft ones.

Scalability, as LDAP is designed to scale with the needs of the organization.

Group Policy Management, allowing to define and enforce policies, security settings, and configurations for user accounts and computers throughout your network.
